### ❓ Q1: What’s the Difference Between “Amazon” Services and “AWS” Services?

In AWS, some services are prefixed with **“Amazon”** and others with **“AWS”** — and this naming isn’t random. It reflects the **type and purpose** of the service.

### ✅ **Amazon Services** – Core Building Blocks

These are foundational services that provide the **main compute, storage, and database functionalities**.

Examples:

* **Amazon EC2** – Virtual servers in the cloud (compute)
* **Amazon S3** – Scalable object storage
* **Amazon RDS** – Managed relational databases
* **Amazon Lambda** – Serverless compute functions

> 🟡 **Think of these as the core “cloud resources” you run your workloads on.**

### ✅ **AWS Services** – Management & Support Tools

These services are focused on **managing, configuring, monitoring**, or **securing** your cloud infrastructure.

Examples:

* **AWS IAM** – Identity and access management
* **AWS CloudWatch** – Monitoring and logging
* **AWS CloudFormation** – Infrastructure as code
* **AWS VPC** – Virtual networking setup

> 🔵 **These help you operate and govern your Amazon resources efficiently.**

### 🧠 **Why the Naming Difference?**

* **“Amazon”** services typically refer to the **core services** that provide direct compute or storage functionality.
* **“AWS”** services are **platform-level tools** that help manage or extend those core services.
